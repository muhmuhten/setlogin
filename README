setlogin - set login name, then exec
====================================

Usage
-----

    setlogin name prog...

Description
-----------

Exactly what it says on the tin; see setlogin(2) for more detail.

Caveats
-------

This is a BSDism. Consult your system's manpage on getlogin for more detail as
to whether this is a necessary or even useful operation.

Normally the login name is set properly on login, so you're unlikely to need
this unless you're spawning interactive programs on behalf of another user from
the init environment or similar.

License
-------

ISC License, see COPYING. This is an absolutely trivial program though; a clean
room implementation probably wouldn't differ by more than three or four words.
